# Elliptic-Curve-Cryptography
This repo contains a study and a Python implementation of [Elliptic-Curve-Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography), an approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. Three discrete logarithm-based cryptographic schemes are provided: 
1. [Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie–Hellman)
2. [Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm)
3. [Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Encryption_Scheme)

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 +
- Matplotlib
- PyCryptoDome
- Numpy

## Getting Started
